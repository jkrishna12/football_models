# Football Models

These models were created by following David Sumpter's Soccermatics online course. I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and as a result I have become confident in using football event data to create statistical models to evaluate a player. Through developing these models, I have learnt that each model has its own strengths and limitations and this can effect the final results.  

# Technical Skills
- Used Pandas to manipulate Wyscout datasets to create relevant features for the statisitcal models
- Leveraged XGBoostClassifier and Linear Regression model to create an action based expected threat model
- Developed an expected goals model using logistic regression and the angle and distance of a shot as features
